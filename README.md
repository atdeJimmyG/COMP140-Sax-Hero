#LICENCE
I am using the GNU GPL-3.0 licesnse as I felt it was the best for my needs. I want my code to be open source but to whoever will want to use this code, will have to reference myself and the GNU GPL-3.0 license in their work. This license also makes sure that I am not liable for any errors or bugs that may be within the repository.
